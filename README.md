# Custom SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save that logo as an SVG file. The user input includes selecting a shape and color, providing text for the logo, and saving the generated logo to a designated directory.

- The motivation for this application comes from how it enables end users to create his/her/their own custom logo.
- This custom logo maker was created to extend an easy and convenient way to produce a customized logo.
- With this tool, end users have an additional way to create a logo, ridding the need for outsourcing.
