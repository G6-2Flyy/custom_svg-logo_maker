# Custom SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save that logo as an SVG file. The user input includes selecting a shape and color, providing text for the logo, and saving the generated logo in the designated directory.

- The motivation for this application comes from how it enables end users to create his/her/their own custom logo.
- This custom logo maker was created to extend a easy, convenient, and cost effective way to produce a customized logo.
- This application seeks to reduce the amount of time and money necessary to generate a simple logo.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
